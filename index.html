            <h2>Her Life</h2>
            <div class="intro-p">
                <p> The Mexican artist Frida Kahlo was born 6 July 1907 in Mexico City and died 13 July 1954.
                    <br>She is famously known for her self-portraits and her life which was
                    filled with passion, bold vibrant colours and chronic pain.
                    <br>
                    Frida started painting at a young age, but would not become famous until much later in life,
                    and perhaps reached her ultimate fame after
                    she had passed away.
                    She contracted polio as a child which caused her chronic pain.
                    <br>
                    Additionally at the
                    age of 18 Frida was involved in a bus-accident which left her impaled with an iron
                    handrail that pierced her pelvis. This caused tremendous damage on her body and resulted in
                    months of hospitalisation and additional at-home-bed-rest for years.
                    <br>
                    In 1928 Frida married a famous Mexican mural painter by the name of Diego Rivera. Diego was twenty
                    years her senior. She continued her own painting but was at that time overshadowed by her famous
                    spouse.

            <h2>Her Career</h2>
            <div class="intro-p">
                <p>It is estimated that she painted around 150-200 pieces during her career which is considered to have
                    started in the 1920s and continued until the 1950s when she passed away.
                    <br>Much of her artwork is known for vibrant colours, self-portraits of different variations, and
                    quite often pain is reflected in her work. Many pieces will contain graphic painful images depicting
                    her
                    injuries.
                    <br>
                    She is celebrated in her native homeland of Mexico and across the world for her attention to
                    Mexican and indigenous culture and for her depiction of the female experience and form. She drew
                    much inspiration from Mexican folk art.

            <h2>Her Legacy</h2>
            <div class="intro-p">
                <p> Even though Frida was active and known in the artworld during her lifetime, it was not until the
                    1970s, more than 20 years after her passing, that she would be recognised by feminist scholars and
                    art-critics for her ground-breaking and often provocative art.
                    <br>
                    She was named one of the most important artists of the twentieth century by Tate Modern Museum
                    in London among other art institutions. Her native Mexico long considers her art a national cultural
                    heritage and
                    she is celebrated internationally.
                    <br>
                    To this day about 70 years after her passing her art continues to inspire and gain new popularity
                    across the world. And the term "Fridamania" has been coined to describe the phenomenon.
